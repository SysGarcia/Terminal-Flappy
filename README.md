# Terminal Flappy

Terminal Flappy is a text-based version of the popular game Flappy Bird, adapted for command-line interfaces. In this game, players must navigate a character through gaps in pipes by avoiding collisions. The game is simple to play but challenging to master, as the gaps in the pipes are randomly placed and require quick reflexes to navigate successfully.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To play Terminal Flappy, you'll need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `keyboard` Python module

### How to Play

1. Open your command line interface (CLI).

2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded `terminal_flappy.py`:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/terminal-flappy
   ```
    Start the game by running:
    ```windows
    python terminal_flappy.py
    ```
    -The game will start immediately. Use the Spacebar to make the > character "flap" and move upwards. When you're not pressing the Spacebar, the character will move downwards, simulating gravity.

    -Your goal is to navigate through the gaps in the pipes that come towards the > character. If you touch a pipe, it's game over!

    -The pipes will automatically move leftward across the terminal window. Time your flaps carefully to move through each gap.

    -The game speed is consistent, so get into a rhythm to increase your chances of success.

    -The console will refresh for each frame of the game to create the animation effect of movement. For the best experience, maximize your terminal window before starting the game.

    -To quit the game, you can simply close the terminal window, or press CTRL+C in the terminal to issue a keyboard interrupt.

Strategy Tips
   ```
    Don't press the Spacebar too much or too littleâ€”find a good balance to move through the pipes effectively.
    Anticipate the gravity's pull; start pressing the Spacebar just before reaching the pipe to ensure you don't collide.
    Practice makes perfect. The more you play, the better you'll get at judging when to flap.
   ```
Happy flapping, and have fun!
